1. Install remote-container VS code extension.
2. Install docker.
3. Click on green button in bottom left corner
    -> Open folder in container
4. It'll create the docker VM and launch it.

Alternatively without VS Code (Unix-like systems):
1. Install docker
2. script/start (wait a bit for the services to spin up)
3. script/migrate
4. script/enable_cors
