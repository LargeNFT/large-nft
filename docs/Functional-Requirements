User Facing Site

    * Can be accessed via 
        - Traditional domain pointed at IPFS. 
        - An IPFS gateway.
        - Hopefully other ways of resolving it. ENS etc.     
        - Large app through "Load a site" 
        - Any whitelabeled app through "Load a site" 

    - Accessed via a single published IPFS CID. It will contain a JSON object with:
    
        * Wallet address
        * Large version number: This is the IPFS hash of the published release. 
        * IPNS address where the site author will update when they publish new content.

    - Loads the static, published version of the content.

        - If the user has a wallet load the web3 functionality.
            * Without a wallet the user is in read-only mode. 

        - Loads orbit. Connect to pubsub. Begins to replicate underlying data.

            - Page will be able to display new data when it arrives.
